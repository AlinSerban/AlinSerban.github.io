                <p>Our goal is to build a reliable (constant uptime) and innovative system that is also easy to use. Ultimately we desire to build a quality product that will improve people’s ways of life. Our system will feature both a mobile and a web interface and will be highly customisable, according to the patient’s needs. By using our system, customers will benefit from a guaranteed health risk reduction.

                        <li>House control system: Lights, HVAC;</li>
                        <li>Access to the patient’s medication program. Also, the system will make sure to notify patient about taking his medication through notifications and alarm. Also, we will try and support the Electronic Visit Verification System. This is an authentication system for the house, in order to see which doctor and when he/she comes to visit the patient. This is a measure to avoid patient neglection;
                        </li>
                        <li>Sensors will be spread throughout the house for patient monitoring. We will provide a way to map each sensor to a specific position, according to the house plan (blueprint) directly through the application;</li>
                        <li>Constant monitoring of vital signs. This can be done by the addition of a wearable. Realtime feed will be mandatory. The patient can also see his vital signs;
                        </li>
                        <li>Access to the patient's personal medical record. Thanks to this, we can now go paperless. It’s more secure, and far easier to deal with than paper notes and files;
                        </li>
                        <li>Direct contact with the responsible doctor or caretaker - via skype or another video conferencing tool. Communication can be started both ways. If the doctor will not respond, he will receive a notification on his personal smartphone;
                        </li>
                        <li>For younger patients that are familiar with smartphone technology, we will provide a chat option with the doctor;
                        </li>
                        <li>Fall sensor and distress signal. This will be placed on the wearable device, and will alert the nearest hospital in case of an emergency; </li>
                        <li>For younger patients that are going through recuperation (for example as a result of an accident) we will provide connectivity with fitness tracker-like devices (Ex: FitBit, JawBone). The goal of this is to monitor their progress in real time, and see if the workout program (stretching, therapy etc) is effective.(* This is an optional feature and will be implemented during the later stages of the project).
